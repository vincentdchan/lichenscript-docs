# Enumerations

An enumeration defines a common type for a group of related values and enables you to work with those values in a type-safe way within your code.

## Enumeration Syntax

You introduce enumerations with the `enum` keyword and place their entire definition within a pair of braces:

```js
public enum Option<A> {
    case Some(A)
    case None
}
```

## Matching Enumeration Values with a Match Expression

You can match individual enumeration values with a `match` expression:

```js
let a = Some(1);
match a {
    case Some(i) => {
        print("Some")
    }
    case None => {
        print("None")
    }
}
```

## Method

Methods are functions that belong to instances of a particular enumeration.
You write an instance method within the opening and closing braces of the enumeration it belongs to.

Hereâ€™s an example that defines a simple `Option` class, which is defined in
the standard library:

```js
public enum Option<A> {
    case Some(A)
    case None

    public isSome(): boolean {
        match this {
            case Some(_) => true
            case _ => false
        }
    }

    public isNone(): boolean {
        match this {
            case None => true
            case Some(_) => false
        }
    }

}
```

The `Option` class defines two instance methods:

- `isSome()` judges if the enum is in the case of `Some`
- `isNone()` judges if the enum is in the case of `None`

You call instance methods with the same dot syntax as properties:

```js
let a = Some(1);
print(a.isSome());  // => true
print(a.isNone());  // => false
```
