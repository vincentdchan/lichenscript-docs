# Lambda Expression

You use a lambda expression to create an anonymous function.
A lambda expression can be of any of the following two forms:

- Expression lambda that has an expression as its body:

```text
(input-parameters) => expression
```

- Statement lambda that has a statement block as its body:

```text
(input-parameters) => { <sequence-of-statements> }
```

Example:

```js
const arr = [3, 2, 1, 4, 5];
arr.sort((a: i32, b: i32): i32 => a - b);
```
