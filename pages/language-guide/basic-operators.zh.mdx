# Basic Operators

An operator is a special symbol or phrase that you use to check, change, or combine values.
For example, the addition operator (`+`) adds two numbers,
as in `const i = 1 + 2`,
and the logical AND operator (`&&`) combines two Boolean values, as in `if isPrime && isEven`.

LichenScript supports the operators you may already know from languages like JavaScript.
The assignment operator (`=`) doesnâ€™t return a value, to prevent it from being mistakenly used when the equal to operator (`==`) is intended.

## Assignment Operator

The assignment operator (`a` = `b`) initializes or updates the value of a with the value of `b`:

```js
const b = 10
let a = 5
a = b
// a is now equal to 10
```

## Arithmetic Operators

LichenScript supports the four standard arithmetic operators for all number types:

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)

```js
1 + 2       // equals 3
5 - 3       // equals 2
2 * 3       // equals 6
10.0 / 2.5  // equals 4.0
```

The addition operator is also supported for `string` concatenation:

```js
"hello, " + "world"  // equals "hello, world"
```

## Comparison Operators

LichenScript supports the following comparison operators:

- Equal to (a `==` b)
- Not equal to (a `!=` b)
- Greater than (a `>` b)
- Less than (a `<` b)
- Greater than or equal to (a `>=` b)
- Less than or equal to (a `<=` b)

Each of the comparison operators returns a Bool value to indicate whether or not the statement is true:

```js
1 == 1   // true because 1 is equal to 1
2 != 1   // true because 2 isn't equal to 1
2 > 1    // true because 2 is greater than 1
1 < 2    // true because 1 is less than 2
1 >= 1   // true because 1 is greater than or equal to 1
2 <= 1   // false because 2 isn't less than or equal to 1
```
