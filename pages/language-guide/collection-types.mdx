# Collection Types

Swift provides three primary collection types, known as arrays and maps.

## Array

```js
const arr = [3, 2, 1, 4, 5];
```

### Push elements to array

```js
const a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];
let i = 0;
while i < 100 {
    a.push(i);
    i += 1;
}
```

### Resize array

```js
a.resize(10, 6);
```

## Map

```js
let a = #{
	"name": "Vincent Chan"
};
```

A map with type `Map<string, string>` will return.

### Get a value from the map

```js
let test = a.get("name");
match test {
	case Some(name) => print("found: ", name)
	case None => print("not found")
}
```
