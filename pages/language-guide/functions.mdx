# Functions

Functions are self-contained chunks of code that perform a specific task. You give a function a name that identifies what it does, and this name is used to “call” the function to perform its task when needed.

## Defining and Calling Functions

```js

function binarySearch(data: i32[], key: i32): Option<i32> {
    let low = 0;
    let high = data.length - 1;

    while low <= high {
        const mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        
        if key == data[mid] {
            return Some(mid);
        } else if key < data[mid] {
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    None
}

```

## Main function

A function named `main` is the entry of the program:

```js
function main() {
    print("Hello World");
    print("你好世界");
}
```
