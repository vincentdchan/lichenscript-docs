# The Basics

**LichenScript** is a lightweight language compiled to JavaScript/C.

## Constants and Variables
Constants and variables associate a name with a value of a particular type (such as the number 10 or the string "Hello"). The value of a constant can’t be changed once it’s set, whereas a variable can be set to a different value in the future.

## Declaring Constants and Variables

Constants and variables must be declared before they’re used.
You declare constants with the `const` keyword and variables with the `let` keyword.
Here’s an example of how constants and variables can be used to track the number of login attempts a user has made:

```js
const maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts = 10
let currentLoginAttempt = 0
```

## Basic Type

 - `unit`
 - `i32`
 - `f32`
 - `i64`
 - `f64`
 - `string`
 - `array`
 - `Map`

## Literals

```js
const n1 = 1;    // i32
const n2 = 1L;   // i64
const n3 = 1.0;  // f64
const n4 = 1.0f; // f32
```
