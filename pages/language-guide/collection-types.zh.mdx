# Collection Types

LichenScript provides three primary collection types, known as tuples, arrays and maps.

## Tuple

In LichenScript, a tuple is a value that contains a fixed number of elements, each with its own type. Tuples are immutable.

Tuples are especially handy for returning multiple values from a method.

A tuple with two elements can be created as follows:

```js
const tuple = ("one", 1);
```

This creates a tuple containing a `string` element and an `i32` element.

### Pattern matching on tuples

A tuple can also be taken apart using pattern matching:

```js
match tuple {
	case (name, num) => print("name: ", name, " num: ", num)
}
```

Here nameâ€™s inferred type is `string` and num's inferred type is `i32`.

## Array

```js
const arr = [3, 2, 1, 4, 5];
```

### Get the length of an array

```js
arr.length
```

### Push elements to array

```js
const a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];
let i = 0;
while i < 100 {
    a.push(i);
    i += 1;
}
```

### Slice an array

```js
arr.slice(2, 3)
```

### Resize array

Resize the array with a default value.

```js
a.resize(10, 0);
```

## Maps

Maps are collections of key-value associations.

```js
let a = #{
	"name": "Vincent Chan"
};
```

A map with type `Map<string, string>` will return.

### Get a value from the map

```js
let test = a.get("name");
match test {
	case Some(name) => print("found: ", name)
	case None => print("not found")
}
```
