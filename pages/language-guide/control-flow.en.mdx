# Control Flow

LichenScript provides a variety of control flow statements.
These include `while` loops to perform a task multiple times;
`if` and `match` expression to execute different branches of code based on certain conditions; and statements such as break and continue to transfer the flow of execution to another point in your code.

## If

In its simplest form, the `if` expression has a single `if` condition.
It executes a set of statements only if that condition is `true`.

```js
if num % i == 0 {
    counter += 1;
}
```

Unlike most common C-family languages,
`if` is an expression in LichenScript.
You can use it in another expression.

```js
const max = if a > b { a } else { b };
print(max);
```

## While

A `while` loop starts by evaluating a single condition.
If the condition is `true`,
a set of statements is repeated until the condition becomes `false`.

```js
while nextTerm < 100 {
    t1 = t2;
    t2 = nextTerm;
    nextTerm = t1 + t2;
}
```

## For

A `for` statement is used to iterate a iterable object such as array and map.

```js
const a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];
for item in a {
    print("item:", item);
}
```
