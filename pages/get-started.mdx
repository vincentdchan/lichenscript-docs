# Get Started

## Prerequisite

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

macOS:

- Install [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

Linux:

- Install [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)


## Install

```shell
npm install -g lichenscript
```

## Quick Start

Make a new directory, and create a file named `main.lc` in it.

Coding in this file:

```js
function main() {
    print("Hello World");
    print("你好世界");
}
```

Execute the command to run:

```shell
lsc run ./main.lc
```

## JavaScript

You can use the flag `--platform` to tell the compiler
to compile to JavaScript:

```shell
lsc run --platform js ./main.lc
```

## WebAssembly

Make sure you have installed [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).
And make sure `emcc` is available in your shell.

Execute the command:

```shell
lsc run --platform wasm32 ./main.lc
```

### Standalone WebAssembly

By default, the compiler generate the wasm files along with
a JavaScript file to load the WebAssembly file.

But if you want to compile LichenScript to a standalone wasm
and load with a runtime, you can use the flag `--standalone-wasm`.

For example, if you want use [wasmedge](https://wasmedge.org/) to execute the wasm file,
execute the command:

```shell
lsc run --platform wasm32 --standalone-wasm wasmedge ./main.lc
```

A standalone wasm will be generated and the compiler will
spawn wasmedge to execute the wasm.

Before you execute this above command, make sure you have install [wasmedge](https://wasmedge.org/).
