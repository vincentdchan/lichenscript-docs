# Conditional Compilation

Sometimes you want some code that is only available on some specific platforms.
You need conditional compilation.

In LichenScript, you can use an attribute to tell the compiler whether to use the code in specific platforms.
That's the `platform` tag.

For example, you want to define a platform-specific function named fork.
Then you add an attribute to it.

```js
@platform("native")
function fork() {
	// TODO
}
```

You can add multiple platforms:

```js
@platform("native", "wasm32")
function fork() {
	// TODO
}
```
