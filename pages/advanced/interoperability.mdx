# Interoperability

LichenScript is a thin layer of the existing ecosystem.
All the low-level operations depend on the target system.
This chapter will show you how to interoperate the target language and LichenScript.

## Example

The source code of [file system](https://github.com/lichenscript/lichenscript-fs)
is a very excellent example to demonstrate how to interoperate.

## C

This chapter tells you how to write your own functions
can be called from the LichenScript.

### Import the sources

The `.h` and `.c` files can be directly imported into the module in LichenScript.

```js
@platform("native")
import "./foo.h";

@platform("native")
import "./foo.c";
```

### Create a primitive value

You can use the macro `MK_I32` to create a value in LichenScript.

Some primitive types can be directly accessed.

- `LC_NULL`
- `LC_TRUE`
- `LC_FALSE`

## JavaScript

Values in LichenScript are different from JavaScript.
