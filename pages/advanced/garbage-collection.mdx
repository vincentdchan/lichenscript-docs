# Garbage collection

## Target C

LichenScript use both Reference Counting
and mark-and-sweep to reclaim unused memory.

All the objects in LichenScript has a counter
to count the references. When the counter go down to zero,
the memory of the object will be freed.

But there a problem called cyclic references, which lead to memory leaks.
So a mark-and-sweep collector is introduced to solve this problem.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The mark-and-sweep collector is not stable yet. So it's turned off by default.
  It will be opened by default as soon as possible.
</Callout>

## Target JavaScript

JavaScript has its own garbage collector.
There is nothing to worry about.
